/*NOTEE::::
There are two options to choose from regarding how the system will be displayed. If your system display resolution
is any higher than 1366*768, you will have to choose either lessen your resolution to 1366*768 and use the Fullscreen option
OR if you don't want to change your display resolution and don't mind viewing the system in a minimized mode then keep your
resolution as is and use the Titlebar option.
Keep in mind that you can close the window only using the esc button in either of the mentioned options!
The options are at lines 46 & 47 and the Fullscreen one is used now.
